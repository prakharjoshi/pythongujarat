        <h2>PythonPune googlegroup posting policy</h2>
<p>We respect the fact that mails reaching users via our forum demand a small amount of attention from all the forum members. We also respect that there are lots of competing interests which demand similar attention from our members. There are many topics that some members might find worthy of sharing, and yet not all other members are likely to be equally excited about receiving information on those topics. With due respect to the attention the members give to mails from this forum, we restrict posting on the google group forums to the following</p>

<ul>
<li>Any topics related to python</li>

<li>Any topics related to the group itelf or its administrative functioning.</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be noted, that the following, are explicitly listed as not to be posted on the forum.</p>

<ul>
<li>Job Postings (even if related to python).</li>

<li>News / Announcements of events of interest to programmers in general, but of no particular direct relevance to python (irrespective of whether these are within or without Pune city).</li>
</ul>
